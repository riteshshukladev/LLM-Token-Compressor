A tool for compressing and decompressing JavaScript code to minimize token usage when working with large language models (LLMs). This project uses pattern-based compression with custom mappings, and provides a web-based UI for real-time code compression and decompression. It also includes token count comparisons before and after the compression to help optimize the cost of using LLMs for code-related tasks.

Key Features:

Compress JavaScript code using custom mappings.

Decompress code with exact reverse mapping.

Token count comparison before and after compression.

Web-based interface using React and Monaco Editor.

Built with Node.js backend using Express and Aho-Corasick algorithm for fast pattern replacement.
